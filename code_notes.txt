beep
a copy of a lot of functions that exist in main that work with quasihalting instead of 
halting

brady

chain
implements a procedure which iterates a rule that can apply multiple times 
in a row into a new rule that does it all in one shot

compression
detect sequences of repeated transitions
eventually, detect and generalize sequences of repeated transitions and rules
to prove facts about the machine

linrecur

macro_machines

main
contains a lot of script-like functions that orchestrate everything else

parse

rules
very long file - includes a lot of things related to rules, but 
primarily proving rules and then applying them to the tape

simulate
contains detect_rule for some reason

tape

turing_examples
interesting examples of specific turing machines

turing
defines the turing machine definition everyone uses
