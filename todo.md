TODOs
✓ decide QH via bouncing
✓ decide bouncers that depend on "alignment" via shifting the tape over
✓ categorize stuff remaining after bouncers
✓ aggregate all collected stats so far to estimate eg. proportion of counters

✓ check all goes_left machine and no other machines were proven from previous categorization
✓ perform a quick zoology writeup 
✓ categorize an additional 60 machines that remain after bouncers
✓ aggregate stats again

* read through 30 machines that QH and that don't to ensure they are decided correctly

✓ run fmt
✓ fix tests
* implement "golden master testing"

* start implementing the musical analyzer / compression-based algorithm
* for those machines that do QH, determine *when* they QH
CouldDOs:
✓ for bouncers, start detection later / cut off the first few things to dodge beginning-effects
